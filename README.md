# SimpleJSON
My work from Ch05 of Real World Haskell. It is a very simple Haskell library for working with JSON, aka JavaScript Object
Notation. It consists of both code from the chapter (which I've tried to make clearer in some cases) and work from the end-of-chapter exercises.

This is crude and misteaks guaronted.
